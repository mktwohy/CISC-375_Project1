# Assignment 1: Personal Website

Create a personal website. You will create HTML and CSS documents for a few pages and publish them on a live (publicly accessible) site.

NOTE: you are only allowed to use HTML and CSS that you write yourself along with the Foundation 6 CSS framework (no importing other external libraries).

### To earn a grade of A or B
- 4 pts: Make your website responsive (ensure it works well on a mobile device in addition to a desktop/laptop)
- 4 pts: Ensure the following best practices are followed
    - Links/images to content on your own site should use relative paths
    - Links to other pages on your own site should replace the current window/tab, whereas links to external sites should open in a new window/tab
    - Use scalable font units (e.g. rems)
    - Resize images to the size you will be displaying them (i.e. edit the photo, don't jest resize via HTML/CSS)
        - Prevents downloading an unnecessarily large image file

 

## Submission
---
Code should be saved in a repository on GitHub. Please name your repository username.github.io, where username is your GitHub username. On GitHub, go to the project's settings, and scroll down to the "GitHub Pages" section. For "source", select "branch: main" and folder "/ (root)". In order to submit, you should enter the the project's live URL in Canvas (i.e. https://username.github.io, not https://github.com/username/username.github.io).

You should also submit a checklist of what you feel you have accomplished from the rubric above, and include your total expected score. If it's easier, you can instead list those items you did not get to along with your expected score. This can be made as a comment once you submit the URL.
