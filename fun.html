                <h3>Music</h3>
                <p>
                    I started teaching myself bass in middle school, and then I finally got proper lessons in college.
                    Additionally, I play drums on the side. Through these 10 years, I've released an solo album,
                    started a band (Public Radio Sunday) with my brother and his friends, and put on shows.
                    It's been a gratifying journey, and I expect it to last the rest of my life.
                </p>

                <h3>Programming</h3>
                <p>
                    I fell in love with programming during my freshman year, and I've been coding in
                    my free time ever since. I focus on Android and desktop apps, though I'll dabble in other areas as
                    well.
                    <br/><br/>
                    For examples of projects I've done, see <a href="projects.html">Projects</a>

                <h3>Video Games</h3>
                <p>
                    If I have free time outside of school, work, and my other hobbies, I'll play video games.
                    My favorite games range from fast paced shooters such as Doom Eternal,
                    to slower paced, logistics/building games such as Satisfactory,
                    to rhythm games like Thumper.

                <p>
                    Borris is a Golden Greek tortoise. I've had him for nearly ten years now, and
                    we'll likely be together for many more; his species has been documented as old as 125!
                    His favorite food is bell peppers, and his favorite activities are basking and climbing.
                    When I move out, I plan on building him a massive outdoor enclosure for the Summer months.

                <p>
                    Duke is an exuberant, goofy, and loving dog. He's 8 years old now, but he's still full of energy!
                    His favorite treats are whipped cream, banana, and salmon, and his favorite activities are swimming,
                    playing with my siblings' dogs, and walking through Reservoir Woods, a nature trail near my house.

                    <br/><br/>
                    A fun fact about Duke is that he has his own doorbell!
                    He uses his snout to push it when he wants to come inside
